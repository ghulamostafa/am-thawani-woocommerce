# Introduction
Welcome to the Thawani WooCommerce Payment Gateway plugin!

This plugin offers a seamless and secure way for WooCommerce merchants to accept payments through Thawani, the leading payment platform in Oman. Designed with flexibility and ease of use in mind, it leverages the latest WordPress Blocks technology to provide an intuitive setup and checkout experience.

With this plugin, merchants can enable both tokenized (saved card) payments for returning customers and one-time payments without saving card details. The integration also supports webhooks, allowing you to automate order status updates and other workflows in real time.

Whether youâ€™re looking for a quick and easy payment setup or advanced features like card tokenization and webhook automation, this plugin is built to fit your needs. The following user manual will guide you step-by-step through installation, configuration, and usage to help you get the most out of your Thawani payment integration.
